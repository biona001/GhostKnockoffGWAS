    "\n",
    "+ Processing of LD panels (including downloading and importing the data matrices) is carried out by [EasyLD.jl](https://github.com/biona001/EasyLD.jl). This package should make it easy to import a region of the LD matrix into memory in Julia. \n",
    "+ To partition the extremely large LD matrix into manageable pieces, we directly adopted the output of [ldetect](https://bitbucket.org/nygcresearch/ldetect-data/src/master/) for which `AFR` (african), `ASN` (east Asians), and `EUR` (european) results are already available (position coordinates are given in HG19). For the EUR panel, the autosomes are partitioned into 1703 \"quasi-independent\" regions, see Figure S2 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15069) for summaries. \n",
    "+ Knockoff optimization problem was carried out by [Knockoffs.jl](https://github.com/biona001/Knockoffs.jl). In particular, we defined groups via average-linkage hierarchical clustering, chose group-key variants within each group via Algorithm A1 in the paper with threshold value $c=0.5$, and employed the maximum-entropy group-knockoff solver.\n",
