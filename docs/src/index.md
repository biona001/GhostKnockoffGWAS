# GWAS summary statistics analysis via Knockoff-filter

This is package for performing knockoff-based analysis of GWAS summary statistics. The knockoff-filter finds conditionally independent discoveries while controlling the FDR (false discovery rate) to any specified level. 

!!! warning 

    This package currently only works on Linux platforms with `aarch64` or `x86_64` CPUs. We plan to support mac (`x86_64` and `aarch64`) in the near future, but not for windows.
