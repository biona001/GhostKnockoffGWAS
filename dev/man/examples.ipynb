Light blue dots are knockoff discoveries that are within 1Mb distance to another more significant SNP. Careful readers may recall that in the summary file (shown in step 4), `GhostKnockoffGWAS` discovered 15 SNPs which falls within 11 unique *groups*, but here only 9 SNPs were labelled. This is because some discoveries are too close to each other. In this example, only 9 among 15 SNPs are physically greater than 1Mb apart. This immediate begs the question of how many discoveries one should report. Our papers typically report the number of discoveries physically >1Mb apart (i.e. 9 discoveries in this case), but please note that there are in fact at least 11 conditionally independent discoveries according to the knockoff methodology.\n",
    "+ The marginal plot is a standard Manhattan plot with the y-axis plotting the negative logged p-values. Similar to the knockoff plot, all dots above the dotted line are marginally significant and colored with light blue, while the most signicant SNP within 1Mb region is colored with purple. \n",
