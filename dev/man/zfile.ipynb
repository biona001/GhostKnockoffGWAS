    "1. It is a comma- or tab-separated file (.gz compressed is acceptable)\n",
    "2. The first row should be a header line, and every row after the first will be treated as a different SNP. \n",
    "3. The header line should include `CHR`, `POS`, `REF`, `ALT`, and `Z`. The `ALT` allele will be treated as the effect allele and `REF` be treated as non-effect allele. The POS (position) field of each variant must be from HG19 or HG38, which must be specified by the `--genome-build` argument. CHR/POS/REF/ALT fields cannot have missing values. Missing Z scores can be specified as `NaN` or as an empty cell.\n",
