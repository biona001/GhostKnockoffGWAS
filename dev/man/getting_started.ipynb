    "# Getting started with Ghost Knockoff GWAS analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is for generating *Ghost Knockoffs* for analyzing summary statistics from a genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The methodology is described in the following papers\n",
    "\n",
    "> He Z, Chu BB, Yang J, Gu J, Chen Z, Liu L, Morrison T, Bellow M, Qi X, Hejazi N, Mathur M, Le Guen Y, Tang H, Hastie T, Ionita-laza, I, Sabatti C, Cande0s C. \"In silico identification of putative causal genetic variants\", bioRxiv 2024. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main working assumption is that we do not have access to individual level genotype or phenotype data. Rather, for each SNP, we have its Z-scores with respect to some phenotype from a GWAS, and access to LD (linkage disequilibrium) data. The user is expected supply the Z-scores, while we supply the LD data in addition to some pre-computed knockoff data."

    "If instead you have individual level genotypes, you should run a GWAS using standard tools (e.g. BOLT, GCTA, SAIGE, GEMMA, ...etc) before running GhostKnockoffGWAS."
